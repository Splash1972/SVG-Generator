# SVG-Generator

A program using inquirer to generate a logo based on the user's choices via the terminal.

It will prompt the user to make selections, and then enter text (maximum of 3 characters).

The svg logo will be created, and then viewed via a browser.  Also, the console will log the success of the generated logo.
